# Hole-Plate-Problem
Theses Python codes solve the hole plate problem with an axial stress in a surface with analitical solutions and FEM,
with differents meshes and plotting the results in Paraview format (vtk).

Disclaimer: The last code to solve the FEM solution has a mistake in the results, so be careful
